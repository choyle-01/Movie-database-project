# Project proposal
_Authors, Benjamin Zah & Michael Hoyle_

## Description
Our task in this project was to use our exsisting knowledge of front end development and create a website that uses all of our knowledge to meet the required goals. For this project we were supposed to use a CSS framework to style and layout of webpage. We decided to go with bootstrap V 5.0.2 and use this to layout our project and apply some of the stylings to it. The next task was for the project to be interactive, we accomplished this by having a user input form where they could search for movies to view gifs and movie information for said movie. We also had to include at least two server side APIs in the project. We decided to use Giphy and Online Movie Data Base. In addition we were required to use client-side storage to store data to the page. We chose to have a search history based on the user's previous searches. This search history was stored as buttons and allowed the user the user to view any of that data again if they chose to do so. We were able to make our site responsive through the use of bootstrap. Bootstrap also helped in making a clean polished UI that is easy to access and understand. Our repository was also kept very clean through the process and the use of neat and organized folders was something that was kept things organized. The project was very fun to work on and a fun implementation of the guidelines.

## Acknowledgments
Throughout his project we were both able to approach work flow in a way that made sure neither one of us were overcontributing to the project. We split up a lot of the tasks that needed to be done between styling, HTML layout, and javaScript. If we both needed to be working on javaSctipt or styling layout we would take turns working on that specific thing and share a screen between the two of us so we could both work on it. We would split off and work on seperate things at times but we did a lot of team work as well. Neither of us felt overworked or stressed and we got our project finished in a timely efficient manner.
