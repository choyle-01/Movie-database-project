# Project proposal
_Authors, Benjamin Zah & Michael Hoyle_
​
Our goal is to make a web application that takes song lyrics, targets specific words, and changes them with a synonym to create a funny parody of the song lyrics. 
​
## APIs
​
* [Musixmatch](https://developer.musixmatch.com/)
* [WordsAPI](https://www.wordsapi.com/)

_both APIs are free of use for these requirements_
​
## Future functions
​
* User able to search/find desired song
* User will then be able to target specific reoccuring words in the song
* User is then able to pick through several suggested synonyms in the song to create a funny parody
